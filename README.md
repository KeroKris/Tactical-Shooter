Main Side Project for Learning Java
Side project for learning Java.

Based on youtube tutorial by IndieProgrammer found on the link below, though it differs in much of the genre and gameplay.

This project is mainly for learning the language and its functionality. 
The goal is not, at least initially, to make everything optimal or beautiful codewise. 
However I have plans to continually refactor my code.

The philosophy here is to make things work and get a result, find out for myself what works as intended and what should be changed. 
This will of course coexist with me becoming more proficient with Java and discovering better ways to do things outside of the project.
